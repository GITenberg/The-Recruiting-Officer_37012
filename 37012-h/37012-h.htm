<h3>REMARKS.</h3>

<p>If the two last acts of this drama were equal to
the three first, it would rank the foremost among Farquhar's
works; for these are brilliant in wit, humour,
character, incident, and every other requisite necessary
to form a complete comedy. But the decrease of
merit in a play, on approaching its conclusion, is, as
in all other productions, of most unfortunate consequence.</p>

<p>The author was himself a recruiting officer, and
possibly gathered all the materials for this play on the
very spot where he has placed his scene&mdash;Shrewsbury.
He has dedicated the piece "to all friends round the
Wrekin," and has thanked the inhabitants of the town
for that cheerful hospitality, which made, he adds, "the
recruiting service, to some men the greatest fatigue on
earth, to me the greatest pleasure in the world."</p>

<p>He even acknowledges, that he found the country
folk, whom he has here introduced&mdash;meaning those
most excellently drawn characters of Rose, her brother,
and the two recruits,&mdash;under the shade of that
beforementioned hill near Shrewsbury, the Wrekin;
and it may be well supposed, that he discovered Serjeant
Kite in his own Regiment, and Captain Plume
in his own person. Certainly those characters
have every appearance of being copied from life&mdash;and
probably, many other of his Salopian acquaintance
have here had their portraits drawn to perfection.</p>

<p>The disguise of Sylvia in boy's clothes, is an improbable,
and romantic occurrence; yet it is one of
those dramatic events, which were considered as perfectly
natural in former times; although neither history,
nor tradition, gives any cause to suppose,
that the English ladies were accustomed to attire
themselves in man's apparel; and reason assures us,
that they could seldom, if ever, have concealed their
sex by such stratagem.</p>

<p>Another incident in the "Recruiting Officer" might
have had its value a hundred years ago&mdash;just the
time since the play was first acted; but to the present
generation, it is so dull, that it casts a heaviness upon
all those scenes, whereon it has any influence. Fortune-tellers
are now a set of personages, in whom,
and in whose skill or fraud, no rational person takes
interest; and though such people still exist by their
profession, they are so vile, they are beneath satire;
and their dupes such ideots, they do not even enjoy
sense enough, for their folly to produce risibility.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the author despised this part of his play,
as much as the severest critic can do; but having expended
his store of entertainment upon the foregoing
scenes, he was compelled to supply the bulk of the
two last acts, from the scanty fund of wasted spirits,
and exhausted invention.</p>

<p>The life of Farquhar was full of adventures.&mdash;As a
student, he was expelled the college of Dublin, for
adventuring profane wit upon a sacred theme, given
to him by his tutor for his exercise.</p>

<p>As an actor, he forsook the stage in grief and horror,
on having unknowingly made use of a real sword,
instead of a counterfeit one, by which he wounded a
brother performer, with whom he had to fence in a
tragedy, nearly to the loss of his life.</p>

<p>In love, and marriage, his enterprises were still
more unhappily terminated.&mdash;And merely as an author,
and a soldier, can any events of his life be accounted
prosperous.</p>

<p>As a dramatic writer, Farquhar was eminently
successful; and in his military capacity, he was ever
honoured and beloved&mdash;whether fighting with a great
army in Flanders, or recruiting with a small party in
Shropshire.</p>

<p>Kite. [<i>Making a Speech.</i>] If any gentlemen soldiers
or others, have a mind to serve his majesty, and pull
down the French king; if any 'prentices have severe
masters, any children have undutiful parents; if any
servants have too little wages, or any husband too
much wife, let them repair to the noble Serjeant Kite,
at the sign of the Raven, in this good town of
Shrewsbury, and they shall receive present relief and
entertainment.&mdash;[<i>Drum.</i>]&mdash;Gentlemen, I don't beat
my drums here to insnare or inveigle any man; for
you must know, gentlemen, that I am a man of honour:
besides, I don't beat up for common soldiers;
no, I list only grenadiers; grenadiers, gentlemen.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Pray,
gentlemen, observe this cap&mdash;this is the
cap of honour; it dubs a man a gentleman, in
the drawing of a trigger; and he, that has the good
fortune to be born six foot high, was born to be a
great man&mdash;Sir, will you give me leave to try this cap
upon your head?</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Is there no harm in't? won't the cap list
me?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> No, no, no more than I can.&mdash;Come, let me
see how it becomes you.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Are you sure there is no conjuration in it?
no gunpowder plot upon me?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> No, no, friend; don't fear, man.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> My mind misgives me plaguily.&mdash;Let me see
it&mdash;[<i>Going to put it on.</i>] It smells woundily of sweat
and brimstone. Smell, Tummas.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Ay, wauns does it.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Pray, Serjeant, what writing is this upon the
face of it?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> The crown, or the bed of honour.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Pray now, what may be that same bed of
honour?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Oh! a mighty large bed! bigger by half
than the great bed at Ware&mdash;ten thousand people
may lie in it together, and never feel one another.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> My wife and I would do well to lie in't, for
we don't care for feeling one another<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But do folk
sleep sound in this same bed of honour?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Sound! ay, so sound that they never wake.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Wauns! I wish again that my wife lay there.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Say you so! then I find, brother<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Brother! hold there friend; I am no kindred
to you that I know of yet.&mdash;Lookye, serjeant, no
coaxing, no wheedling, d'ye see&mdash;If I have a mind to
list, why so&mdash;if not, why 'tis not so&mdash;therefore take
your cap and your brothership back again, for I am
not disposed at this present writing.&mdash;No coaxing, no
brothering me, 'faith.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I coax! I wheedle! I'm above it, sir: I have
served twenty campaigns<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but, sir, you talk well,
and I must own that you are a man, every inch of
you; a pretty, young, sprightly fellow!&mdash;I love a
fellow with a spirit; but I scorn to coax; 'tis base;
though I must say, that never in my life have I seen
a man better built. How firm and strong he treads!
he steps like a castle! but I scorn to wheedle any
man&mdash;Come, honest lad! will you take share of a
pot?</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Nay, for that matter, I'll spend my penny
with the best he that wears a head, that is, begging
your pardon, sir, and in a fair way.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Give me your hand then; and now, gentlemen,
I have no more to say but this&mdash;here's a purse
of gold, and there is a tub of humming ale at my
quarters&mdash;'tis the king's money, and the king's drink&mdash;he's
a generous king, and loves his subjects&mdash;I
hope, gentlemen, you won't refuse the king's health.</p>

<p><i>All Mob.</i> No, no, no.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Huzza, then! huzza for the king, and the honour
of Shropshire.</p>

<p><i>All Mob.</i> Huzza!</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Beat drum.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> By the Grenadier's march, that should be
my drum, and by that shout, it should beat with
success.&mdash;Let me see&mdash;four o'clock&mdash;[<i>Looking on his
Watch.</i>] At ten yesterday morning I left London&mdash;an
hundred and twenty miles in thirty hours is pretty
smart riding, but nothing to the fatigue of recruiting.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Kite</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Welcome to Shrewsbury, noble captain!
from the banks of the Danube to the Severn side,
noble captain! you're welcome.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> A very elegant reception, indeed, Mr. Kite.
I find you are fairly entered into your recruiting
strain&mdash;Pray what success?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I've been here a week, and I've recruited
five.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Five! pray what are they?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I have listed the strong man of Kent, the
king of the gipsies, a Scotch pedlar, a scoundrel attorney,
and a Welsh parson.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> An attorney! wert thou mad? list a lawyer!
discharge him, discharge him, this minute.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Why, sir?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Because I will have nobody in my company
that can write; a fellow that can write, can
draw petitions&mdash;I say this minute discharge him.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> And what shall I do with the parson?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Can he write?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Hum? he plays rarely upon the fiddle.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Keep him, by all means&mdash;But how stands
the country affected? were the people pleased with
the news of my coming to town?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Sir, the mob are so pleased with your honour,
and the justices and better sort of people, are so
delighted with me, that we shall soon do your business<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But,
sir, you have got a recruit here, that
you little think of.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Who?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> One that you beat up for the last time you
were in the country. You remember your old friend
Molly, at the Castle?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> She's not with child, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> She was brought to-bed yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Kite, you must father the child.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> And so her friends will oblige me to marry
the mother.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> If they should, we'll take her with us;
she can wash, you know, and make a bed upon occasion.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Ay, or unmake it upon occasion. But your
honour knows that I am married already.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> To how many?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I can't tell readily&mdash;I have set them down
here upon the back of the muster-roll. [<i>Draws it
out.</i>] Let me see&mdash;<i>Imprimis</i>, Mrs. Shely Snikereyes;
she sells potatoes upon Ormond key, in Dublin&mdash;Peggy
Guzzle, the brandy woman at the Horse
Guards, at Whitehall&mdash;Dolly Waggon, the carrier's
daughter, at Hull&mdash;Mademoiselle Van Bottomflat,
at the Buss&mdash;then Jenny Oakum, the ship-carpenter's
widow, at Portsmouth; but I don't reckon upon
her, for she was married at the same time to
two lieutenants of marines, and a man of war's boatswain.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> A full company&mdash;you have named five&mdash;come,
make them half a dozen&mdash;Kite, is the child
a boy, or a girl?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> A chopping boy.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Then set the mother down in your list, and
the boy in mine; enter him a grenadier, by the name
of Francis Kite, absent upon furlow&mdash;I'll allow you
a man's pay for his subsistence; and now, go comfort
the wench in the straw.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I shall, sir.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> But hold, have you made any use of your
fortune-teller's habit since you arrived?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Yes, yes, sir; and my fame's all about the
country for the most faithful fortune-teller that ever
told a lie&mdash;I was obliged to let my landlord into the
secret, for the convenience of keeping it so; but he is
an honest fellow, and will be faithful to any roguery
that is trusted to him. This device, sir, will get you
men, and me, money, which, I think, is all we
want at present&mdash;But yonder comes your friend,
Mr. Worthy&mdash;Has your honour any further commands?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> None at present. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Kite</span>.] 'Tis indeed,
the picture of Worthy, but the life is departed.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Worthy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What, arms across, Worthy! methinks you should
hold them open when a friend's so near&mdash;The man has

<p><i>Wor.</i> Plume! my dear captain! welcome. Safe

<p><i>Plume.</i> I escaped safe from Germany, and sound, I
hope, from London: you see I have lost neither
leg, arm, nor nose. Then for my inside, 'tis neither
troubled with sympathies, nor antipathies; and I have
an excellent stomach for roast beef.</p>

earthquakes, in Wales, I hope? Has your father
rose from the dead, and reassumed his estate?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Then you are married, surely?</p>

thoughtful, romantic, constant coxcomb.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Shake hands, brother. If you go to that,
behold me as obsequious, as thoughtful, and as constant
a coxcomb, as your worship.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> For whom?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> For a regiment&mdash;but for a woman! 'Sdeath!
I have been constant to fifteen at a time, but never
melancholy for one: and can the love of one bring
you into this condition? Pray, who is this wonderful
Helen?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> A Helen, indeed! not to be won under ten
years' siege; as great a beauty, and as great a jilt.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> A jilt! pho! is she as great a whore?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> No, no.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> 'Tis ten thousand pities!&mdash;But who is she?&mdash;do
I know her?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> That's impossible<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I know no woman
that will hold out a ten years' siege.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> What think you of Melinda?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Melinda! why she began to capitulate this
time twelvemonth, and offered to surrender upon honourable
terms: and I advised you to propose a settlement
of five hundred pounds a year to her, before
I went last abroad.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> I did, and she hearkened to it, desiring only
one week to consider&mdash;when beyond her hopes the
town was relieved, and I forced to turn the siege into
a blockade.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Explain, explain.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> My Lady Richly, her aunt in Flintshire,
dies, and leaves her, at this critical time, twenty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Oh, the devil! what a delicate woman was
there spoiled! But, by the rules of war, now<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Worthy,
blockade was foolish&mdash;After such a convoy
of provisions was entered the place, you could have
no thought of reducing it by famine; you should
have redoubled your attacks, taken the town by
storm, or have died upon the breach.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> I did make one general assault, but was so
vigorously repulsed, that, despairing of ever gaining
her for a mistress, I have altered my conduct, given
my addresses the obsequious, and distant turn, and
court her now for a wife.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> So, as you grew obsequious, she grew
haughty, and, because you approached her like a
goddess, she used you like a dog.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Exactly.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> 'Tis the way of them all<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Come, Worthy,
your obsequious and distant airs will never
bring you together; you must not think to surmount
her pride by your humility. Would you bring her to
better thoughts of you, she must be reduced to a
meaner opinion of herself. Let me see, the very first
thing that I would do, should be, to lie with her
chambermaid, and hire three or four wenches in the
neighbourhood to report, that I had got them with
child&mdash;Suppose we lampooned all the pretty women
in town, and left her out; or, what if we made a ball,
and forgot to invite her, with one or two of the ugliest.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> These would be mortifications I must confess;
but we live in such a precise, dull place, that
we can have no balls, no lampoons, no<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> What, no bastards! and so many recruiting
officers in town! I thought 'twas a maxim among
them, to leave as many recruits in the country as they
carried out.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Nobody doubts your good will, noble captain,
in serving your country; witness our friend Molly
at the Castle; there have been tears in town about
that business, captain.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I hope Sylvia has not heard of it.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Oh, sir, have you thought of her? I began
to fancy you had forgot poor Sylvia.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Your affairs had quite put mine out of my
head. 'Tis true, Sylvia and I had once agreed to go
to bed together, could we have adjusted preliminaries;
but she would have the wedding before consummation,
and I was for consummation before the
wedding: we could not agree.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> But do you intend to marry upon no other
conditions?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Your pardon, sir, I'll marry upon no condition
at all&mdash;If I should, I am resolved never to
bind myself down to a woman for my whole life, till
I know whether I shall like her company for half an
hour. Suppose I married a woman without a leg&mdash;such
a thing might be, unless I examined the goods
before-hand.&mdash;If people would but try one another's
constitutions before they engaged, it would prevent
all these elopements, divorces, and the devil knows
what.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Nay, for that matter, the town did not stick
to say that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I hate country towns for that reason.&mdash;If
your town has a dishonourable thought of Sylvia, it
deserves to be burnt to the ground&mdash;I love Sylvia, I
admire her frank, generous disposition&mdash;there's something
in that girl more than woman&mdash;In short, were
I once a general, I would marry her.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> 'Faith, you have reason&mdash;for were you but
a corporal, she would marry you&mdash;but my Melinda
coquets it with every fellow she sees&mdash;I'll lay fifty
pounds she makes love to you.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I'll lay you a hundred, that I return it if
she does&mdash;Look ye, Worthy, I'll win her, and give her
to you afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> If you win her, you shall wear her, 'faith; I
would not value the conquest, without the credit of
the victory.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Captain, captain! a word in your ear.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> You may speak out, here are none but
friends.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> You know, sir, that you sent me to comfort
the good woman in the straw, Mrs. Molly&mdash;my wife,
Mr. Worthy.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> O ho! very well. I wish you joy, Mr. Kite.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Your worship very well may&mdash;for I have got
both a wife and a child in half an hour&mdash;But as I
was saying&mdash;you sent me to comfort Mrs. Molly&mdash;my
wife, I mean&mdash;but what d'ye think, sir? she was
better comforted before I came.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> As how?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Why, sir, a footman in a blue livery had
brought her ten guineas to buy her baby-clothes.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Who, in the name of wonder, could send
them?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Nay, sir, I must whisper that&mdash;Mrs. Sylvia.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Sylvia! generous creature!</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Sylvia! impossible!</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Here are the guineas, sir&mdash;I took the gold as
part of my wife's portion. Nay, farther, sir, she sent
word the child should be taken all imaginable care
of, and that she intended to stand godmother. The
same footman, as I was coming to you with this
news, called after me, and told me, that his lady
would speak to me&mdash;I went, and upon hearing that
you were come to town, she gave me half a guinea
for the news, and ordered me to tell you, that Justice
Balance, her father, who is just come out of the country,
would be glad to see you.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> There's a girl for you, Worthy!&mdash;Is there
any thing of woman in this? no, 'tis noble, generous,
manly friendship. Show me another woman that
would lose an inch of her prerogative that way, without
tears, fits, and reproaches. The common jealousy
of her sex, which is nothing but their avarice
of pleasure, she despises, and can part with the lover,
though she dies for the man&mdash;Come, Worthy&mdash;where's
the best wine? for there I'll quarter.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> At Horton's.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Let's away, then.&mdash;Mr. Kite, go to the
lady, with my humble service, and tell her, I shall only
refresh a little, and wait upon her.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Hold, Kite&mdash;have you seen the other recruiting
captain?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> No, sir; I'd have you to know I don't keep
such company.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Another! who is he?</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>An Apartment.</i></p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Melinda</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sylvia</span> <i>meeting</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Welcome to town, cousin Sylvia. [<i>Salute.</i>] I
envied you your retreat in the country; for Shrewsbury,
methinks, and all your heads of shires, are the
most irregular places for living: here we have smoke,
scandal, affectation, and pretension; in short, every
thing to give the spleen&mdash;and nothing to divert it&mdash;then
the air is intolerable.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Oh, madam! I have heard the town commended
for its air.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> But you don't consider, Sylvia, how long I
have lived in it; for I can assure you that to a lady
the least nice in her constitution&mdash;no air can be good
above half a year. Change of air I take to be the
most agreeable of any variety in life.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> As you say, cousin Melinda, there are several
sorts of airs.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Psha! I talk only of the air we breathe, or
more properly of that we taste&mdash;Have not you, Sylvia,
found a vast difference in the taste of airs?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Pray, cousin, are not vapours a sort of air?
Taste air! you might as well tell me I may feed upon
air! but pr'ythee, my dear Melinda! don't put on
such an air to me. Your education and mine were
just the same, and I remember the time when we never
troubled our heads about air, but when the sharp air
from the Welsh mountains made our fingers ache in a
cold morning, at the boarding-school.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Our education, cousin, was the same, but our
temperaments had nothing alike; you have the constitution
of an horse.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> So far as to be troubled neither with spleen,
cholic, nor vapours. I need no salts for my stomach,
no hartshorn for my head, nor wash for my complexion;
I can gallop all the morning after the hunting-horn,
and all the evening after a fiddle. In short, I
can do every thing with my father, but drink and
shoot flying; and I am sure I can do every thing my
mother could, were I put to the trial.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> You are in a fair way of being put to't, for I
am told your captain is come to town.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Ay, Melinda, he is come, and I'll take care he
shan't go without a companion.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> You are certainly mad, cousin!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> "And there's a pleasure in being mad,<br />
<span class="ind3">Which none but madmen know".</span></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Thou poor romantic Quixote!&mdash;hast thou the
vanity to imagine that a young sprightly officer, that
rambles o'er half the globe in half a year, can confine
his thoughts to the little daughter of a country justice,
in an obscure part of the world?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Psha! what care I for his thoughts; I should
not like a man with confined thoughts; it shows a
narrowness of soul. In short, Melinda, I think a petticoat
a mighty simple thing, and I am heartily tired
of my sex.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> That is, you are tired of an appendix to our
sex, that you can't so handsomely get rid of in petticoats
as if you were in breeches.&mdash;O'my conscience,
Sylvia, hadst thou been a man, thou hadst been the
greatest rake in Christendom.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I should have endeavoured to know the world,
which a man can never do thoroughly without half
a hundred friendships, and as many amours. But
now I think on't, how stands your affair with Mr.
Worthy?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> He's my aversion.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Vapours!</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What do you say, madam?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I say, that you should not use that honest fellow
so inhumanly: he's a gentleman of parts and fortune,
and besides that, he's my Plume's friend; and by
all that's sacred, if you don't use him better, I shall
expect satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Satisfaction! you begin to fancy yourself in
breeches in good earnest&mdash;But, to be plain with you,
I like Worthy the worse for being so intimate with your
captain; for I take him to be a loose, idle, unmannerly
coxcomb.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Oh, Madam! you never saw him, perhaps,
since you were mistress of twenty thousand pounds:
you only knew him when you were capitulating with
Worthy for a settlement, which perhaps might encourage
him to be a little loose and unmannerly with
you.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What do you mean, madam?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> My meaning needs no interpretation, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Better it had, madam; for methinks you are
too plain.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> If you mean the plainness of my person, I think
your ladyship's as plain as me to the full.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Were I sure of that, I would be glad to take
up with a rakehelly officer, as you do.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Again! lookye, madam, you are in your own
house.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> And if you had kept in yours, I should have
excused you.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Don't be troubled, madam; I shan't desire to
have my visit returned.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> The sooner, therefore, you make an end of
this, the better.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I am easily persuaded to follow my inclinations;
and so, madam, your humble servant.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Lookye, captain, give us but blood for our money,
and you shan't want men. Ad's my life, captain,
get us but another marshal of France, and I'll
go myself for a soldier.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Pray, Mr. Balance, how does your fair
daughter?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Ah, captain! what is my daughter to a marshal
of France? we're upon a nobler subject; I
want to have a particular description of the last
battle.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> The battle, sir, was a very pretty battle as
any one should desire to see; but we were all so intent
upon victory, that we never minded the battle:
all that I know of the matter is, our general commanded
us to beat the French, and we did so; and,
if he pleases but to say the word, we'll do it again.
But pray, sir, how does Mrs. Sylvia?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Still upon Sylvia! for shame, captain! you
are engaged already&mdash;wedded to the war: victory is
your mistress, and 'tis below a soldier to think of any
other.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> As a mistress, I confess&mdash;but as a friend,
Mr. Balance<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Come, come, captain, never mince the
matter; would not you seduce my daughter, if you
could?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> How, sir? I hope she is not to be seduced.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> 'Faith, but she is, sir; and any woman in
England of her age and complexion, by your youth
and vigour. Lookye, captain, once I was young, and
once an officer, as you are, and I can guess at your
thoughts now by what mine were then; and I remember
very well that I would have given one of my legs
to have deluded the daughter of an old country gentleman
like me, as I was then like you.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> But, sir, was that country gentleman your
friend and benefactor?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Not much of that.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> There the comparison breaks: the favours,
sir, that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Pho, pho! I hate set speeches: if I have
done you any service, captain, it was to please myself.
I love thee, and if I could part with my girl,
you should have her as soon as any young fellow I
know; but I hope you have more honour than to quit
the service, and she more prudence than to follow the
camp: but she's at her own disposal; she has five
thousand pounds in her pocket, and so&mdash;Sylvia,

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sir, you are welcome to England.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> You are indebted to me a welcome, madam,
since the hopes of receiving it from this fair
hand was the principal cause of my seeing England.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I have often heard that soldiers were sincere;
may I venture to believe public report?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> You may, when 'tis backed by private insurance;
for I swear, madam, by the honour of my
profession, that whatever dangers I went upon, it was
with the hope of making myself more worthy of your
esteem; and if ever I had thoughts of preserving my
life, 'twas for the pleasure of dying at your feet.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Well, well, you shall die at my feet, or where
you will; but you know, sir, there is a certain will
and testament to be made beforehand.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> My will, madam, is made already, and
there it is; and if you please to open that parchment,
which was drawn the evening before the battle
of Hockstet, you will find whom I left my heir.</p>

<p>Syl. <i>Mrs. Sylvia Balance.</i> [<i>Opens the Will, and
reads.</i>] Well, captain, this is a handsome and substantial
compliment; but I can assure you I am much
better pleased with the bare knowledge of your intention,
than I should have been in the possession of your
legacy: but, methinks, sir, you should have left something
to your little boy at the Castle.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> That's home. [<i>Aside.</i>] My little boy! lack-a-day,
madam! that alone may convince you 'twas
none of mine: why, the girl, madam, is my serjeant's
wife, and so the poor creature gave out that I was the
father, in hopes that my friends might support her in
case of necessity.&mdash;That was all, madam&mdash;my boy!

gentleman afflicted. I'll leave you to comfort him;
and be assured that if my life and fortune can be any

my hands he fears I shall have no son.&mdash;Poor Owen!
but the decree is just; I was pleased with the death
of my father, because he left me an estate; and now I

I must now look upon you as the only hopes of my

fortune will give you fresh thoughts and new prospects.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> My desire in being punctual in my obedience,
requires that you would be plain in your commands,

<p><i>Bal.</i> The death of your brother makes you sole
heiress to my estate, which you know is about three
thousand pounds a year: this fortune gives you a
fair claim to quality and a title: you must set a just
value upon yourself, and, in plain terms, think no
more of Captain Plume.</p>

but though I liked him well enough for a bare son-in-law,
I don't approve of him for an heir to my estate

trust in his hands, and it might do the young fellow a
kindness; but&mdash;od's my life! three thousand pounds

of me?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> I don't; but I would rather counsel than command.
I don't propose this with the authority of a
parent, but as the advice of your friend, that you
would take the coach this moment, and go into the
country.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Does this advice, sir, proceed from the contents
of the letter you received just now?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> No matter; I will be with you in three or
four days, and then give my reasons: but before you
go, I expect you will make me one solemn promise.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Propose the thing, sir.</p>

any man without my consent.</p>

I never will dispose of you without your own

<p><i>Wor.</i> You wrong my honour, in believing I could
know any thing to your prejudice, without resenting
it as much as you should.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> This letter, sir, which I tear in pieces, to conceal
the person that sent it, informs me that Plume
has a design upon Sylvia, and that you are privy
to it.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Nay, then, sir, I must do myself justice, and
endeavour to find out the author. [<i>Takes up a Bit.</i>]&mdash;Sir,
I know the hand, and if you refuse to discover
the contents, Melinda shall tell me.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Hold, sir; the contents I have told you already;
only with this circumstance&mdash;that her intimacy
with Mr. Worthy had drawn the secret from
him.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Her intimacy with me! Dear sir! let me
pick up the pieces of this letter, 'twill give me such a
power over her pride to have her own an intimacy
under her hand.&mdash;This was the luckiest accident!
[<i>Gathering up the Letter.</i>] The aspersion, sir, was nothing
but malice; the effect of a little quarrel between
her and Mrs. Sylvia.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Are you sure of that, sir?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Her maid gave me the history of part of
the battle just now, as she overheard it: but I hope,
sir, your daughter has suffered nothing upon the account.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> No, no, poor girl! she's so afflicted with the
news of her brother's death, that, to avoid company,
she begged leave to go into the country.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> And is she gone?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> I could not refuse her, she was so pressing;
the coach went from the door the minute before you
came.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> So pressing to be gone, sir?&mdash;I find her fortune
will give her the same airs with Melinda, and
then Plume and I may laugh at one another.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Like enough; women are as subject to pride
as men are; and why mayn't great women as well as
great men forget their old acquaintance? But come,
where's this young fellow? I love him so well, it
would break the heart of me to think him a rascal.&mdash;I
am glad my daughter's gone fairly off though.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
Where does the captain quarter?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> At Horton's; I am to meet him there two
hours hence, and we should be glad of your company.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Your pardon, dear Worthy! I must allow a
day or two to the death of my son. The decorum of
mourning is what we owe the world, because they
pay it to us; afterwards I'm yours over a bottle, or
how you will.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Sir, I'm your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> And I'se scarcely d'off mine for any captain
in England. My vether's a freeholder.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Who are those jolly lads, serjeant?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> A couple of honest brave fellows that are
willing to serve the king: I have entertained them
just now as volunteers, under your honour's command.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> And good entertainment they shall have:
volunteers are the men I want; those are the men fit
to make soldiers, captains, generals.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Wounds, Tummas, what's this! are you listed?</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Flesh! not I: are you, Costar?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Home! for shame, gentlemen; behave yourselves
better before your captain. Dear Tummas,
honest Costar!</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> No, no! we'll be gone.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Nay, then, I command you to stay: I place
you both centinels in this place for two hours, to
watch the motion of St. Mary's clock you, and you
the motion of St. Chad's; and he, that dares stir from
his post till he be relieved, shall have my sword in his
guts the next minute.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> What's the matter, serjeant? I'm afraid you
are too rough with these gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I'm too mild, sir; they disobey command,
sir; and one of them should be shot, for an example
to the other.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Shot! Tummas?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Come, gentlemen, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> We don't know; the noble serjeant is pleas'd
to be in a passion, sir; but<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> They disobey command; they deny their
being listed.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Nay, serjeant, we don't downright deny it,
neither; that we dare not do, for fear of being shot;
but we humbly conceive, in a civil way, and begging
your worship's pardon, that we may go home.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> That's easily known. Have either of you
received any of the king's money?</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Not a brass farthing, sir.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> They have each of them received one-and-twenty
shillings, and 'tis now in their pockets.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Wounds! if I have a penny in my pocket
but a bent sixpence, I'll be content to be listed and
shot into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> And I: look ye here, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Nothing but the king's picture, that the serjeant
gave me just now.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> See there, a guinea, one and twenty shillings;
t'other has the fellow on't.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> The case is plain, gentlemen: the goods are
found upon you: those pieces of gold are worth one-and-twenty
shillings each.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> So it seems that Carolus is one-and-twenty
shillings in Latin.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> 'Tis the same thing in Greek, for we are
listed.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Flesh; but we an't, Tummus: I desire to be
carried before the mayor, captain.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smallcaps">Captain</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Serjeant</span> <i>whisper the while</i>.</p>

will ruin me at last&mdash;I won't lose the fellows, though,
if I can help it.&mdash;Well, gentlemen, there must be
some trick in this; my serjeant offers to take his oath
that you are fairly listed.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Why, captain, we know that you soldiers
have more liberty of conscience than other folks;
but for me or neighbour Costar here to take such an
oath, 'twould be downright perjuration.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Lookye, rascal, you villain! If I find that
you have imposed upon these two honest fellows, I'll
trample you to death, you dog&mdash;Come, how was't?</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Nay, then we'll speak. Your serjeant, as you
say, is a rogue, an't like your worship, begging your
worship's pardon&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Nay, Tummus, let me speak, you know I
can read.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>And so, sir, he gave us those two
pieces of money for pictures of the king, by way of
a present.</p>

whore! I'll teach him to abuse honest fellows like
you!&mdash;scoundrel! rogue! villain!</p>

<p><i>Both.</i> O brave noble captain! huzza! A brave
captain, 'faith!</p>

you.&mdash;Lookye, gentlemen, I love a pretty fellow; I
come among you as an officer to list soldiers, not as a
kidnapper to steal slaves.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Mind that, Tummas.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I desire no man to go with me but as I
went myself; I went a volunteer, as you or you may
do; for a little time carried a musket, and now I
command a company.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Mind that, Costar. A sweet gentleman!</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Tis true, gentlemen, I might take an advantage
of you; the king's money was in your pockets&mdash;my
serjeant was ready to take his oath you were
listed; but I scorn to do a base thing; you are both
of you at your liberty.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Thank you, noble captain<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Icod! I can't
find in my heart to leave him, he talks so finely.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Ay, Costar, would he always hold in this
mind.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Come, my lads, one thing more I'll tell
you: you're both young tight fellows, and the army
is the place to make you men for ever: every man
has his lot, and you have yours: what think you of a
purse of French gold out of a monsieur's pocket, after
you have dashed out his brains with the but end of
your firelock, eh?</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i> Wauns! I'll have it. Captain&mdash;give me a
shilling; I'll follow you to the end of the world.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Nay, dear Costar! do'na: be advis'd.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Here, my hero, here are two guineas for
thee, as earnest of what I'll do farther for thee.</p>

<p><i>Tho.</i> Do'na take it; do'na, dear Costar.</p>

to your captain, admirable in your way I find.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Yes, sir, I understand my business, I will
say it.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> How came you so qualified?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i>You must know, sir, I was born a gipsy, and
bred among that crew till I was ten years old; there
I learned canting and lying: I was bought from my
mother Cleopatra by a certain nobleman for three
pistoles, there I learned impudence and pimping: I
was turned off for wearing my lord's linen, and drinking
my lady's ratafia, and turned bailiff's follower;
there I learned bullying and swearing: I at last got into
the army; and there I learned whoring and drinking&mdash;so
that if your worship pleases to cast up the whole
sum, viz. canting, lying, impudence, pimping, bullying,
swearing, whoring, drinking, and a halberd, you
will find the sum total amount to a Recruiting Serjeant.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> And pray what induced you to turn soldier?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Hunger and ambition. But here comes Justice
Balance.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Here you, serjeant, where's your captain?
here's a poor foolish fellow comes clamouring to me
with a complaint that your captain has pressed his
sister. Do you know any thing of this matter, Worthy?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Ha! ha! ha! I know his sister is gone with
Plume to his lodging, to sell him some chickens.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Is that all? the fellow's a fool.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> I know that, an't like your worship; but if
your worship pleases to grant me a warrant to bring
her before your worship, for fear of the worst.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Thou'rt mad, fellow; thy sister's safe enough.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I hope so too.<span class="ind1">&nbsp;</span> [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Hast thou no more sense, fellow, than to believe
that the captain can list women?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> I know not whether they list them, or what
they do with them, but I'm sure they carry as many
women as men with them out of the country.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> But how came you not to go along with your
sister?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Lord, sir, I thought no more of her going than
I do of the day I shall die: but this gentleman here,
not suspecting any hurt neither, I believe&mdash;you
thought no harm, friend, did you?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Lack-a-day, sir, not I<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>only that I believe
I shall marry her to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> I begin to smell powder. Well, friend, but
what did that gentleman with you?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Why, sir, he entertained me with a fine story
of a great sea-fight between the Hungarians, I think
it was, and the wild Irish.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> And so, sir, while we were in the heat of battle&mdash;the
captain carried off the baggage.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Serjeant, go along with this fellow to your
captain, give him my humble service, and desire him
to discharge the wench, though he has listed her.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Ay, and if she ben't free for that, he shall have
another man in her place.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Come, honest friend, you shall go to my quarters
instead of the captain's.<span class="ind1">&nbsp;</span> [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smallcaps">Kite</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Bullock</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> We must get this mad captain his complement
of men, and send him packing, else he'll overrun
the country.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> You see, sir, how little he values your daughter's
disdain.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> I like him the better: I was just such another
fellow at his age: But how goes your affair with Melinda?</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Very slowly. My mistress has got a captain
too, but such a captain!&mdash;as I live, yonder he
comes!</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Who, that bluff fellow in the sash? I don't
know him.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> But I engage he knows you and every body
at first sight: his impudence were a prodigy, were not
his ignorance proportionable; he has the most universal
acquaintance of any man living, for he won't
be alone, and nobody will keep him company twice:
then he's a C&aelig;sar among the women, <i>veni, vidi, vici</i>,
that's all. If he has but talked with the maid, he
swears he has lain with the mistress: but the most
surprising part of his character is his memory, which
is the most prodigious and the most trifling in the
world.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> I have known another acquire so much by
travel as to tell you the names of most places in Europe,
with their distances of miles, leagues, or hours,
as punctually as a postboy; but for any thing else
as ignorant as the horse that carries the mail.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> This is your man, sir, add but the traveller's
privilege of lying, and even that he abuses: this is the
picture, behold the life.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Very laconic, sir.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Laconic! a very good name truly. I
have known several of the Laconics abroad. Poor
Jack Laconic! he was killed at the battle of Landen.
I remember that he had a blue ribband in his hat
that very day, and after he fell, we found a piece of
neat's tongue in his pocket.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Pray, sir, did the French attack us, or we
them, at Landen?</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> The French attack us! No, sir, we attacked
them on the<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I have reason to remember
the time, for I had two-and-twenty horses killed under
me that day.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Then, sir, you must have rid mighty hard.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Or, perhaps, sir, like my countrymen, you rid
upon half a dozen horses at once.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> What do ye mean, gentlemen? I tell you
they were killed, all torn to pieces by cannon-shot,
except six I staked to death upon the enemy's <i>cheveaux
de frise</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Noble captain! may I crave your name?</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Brazen, at your service.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Oh, Brazen! a very good name. I have
known several of the Brazens abroad.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> Do you know one Captain Plume, sir?</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Is he any thing related to Frank Plume in
Northamptonshire?&mdash;Honest Frank! many, many a
dry bottle have we cracked hand to fist. You must
have known his brother Charles, that was concerned
in the India company; he married the daughter of
Old Tonguepad, the master in Chancery, a very
pretty woman, only she quinted a little; she died in
child-bed of her first child, but the child survived:
'twas a daughter, but whether it was called Margaret
or Margery, upon my soul, I can't remember. [<i>Looking
on his Watch.</i>] But, gentlemen, I must meet a
lady, a twenty thousand pounder, presently, upon the
walk by the water&mdash;Worthy, your servant; Laconic,
yours.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> If you can have so mean an opinion of Melinda,
as to be jealous of this fellow, I think she ought
to give you cause to be so.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> I don't think she encourages him so much
for gaining herself a lover, as to set up a rival. Were
there any credit to be given to his words, I should
believe Melinda had made him this assignation. I

<p><i>Mel.</i> And pray was it a ring, or buckle, or pendants,
or knots; or in what shape was the almighty
gold transformed, that has bribed you so much in his
favour?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Indeed, madam, the last bribe I had from
the captain, was only a small piece of Flanders' lace,
for a cap.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Ay, Flanders' lace is a constant present from
officers to their women. They every year bring over
a cargo of lace, to cheat the king of his duty, and his
subjects of their honesty.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> They only barter one sort of prohibited
goods for another, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Has any of them been bartering with you,
Mrs. Pert, that you talk so like a trader?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> One would imagine, madam, by your concern
for Worthy's absence, that you should use him
better when he's with you.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Who told you, pray, that I was concerned for
his absence? I'm only vexed that I have had nothing
said to me these two days: as one may love the treason
and hate the traitor. Oh! here comes another
captain, and a rogue that has the confidence to make
love to me; but indeed, I don't wonder at that, when
he has the assurance to fancy himself a fine gentleman.</p>

I am your humble servant, and all that, madam.
A fine river, this same Severn&mdash;Do you love fishing,
madam?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> 'Tis a pretty melancholy amusement for lovers.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> I'll go and buy hooks and lines presently;
for you must know, madam, that I have served in
Flanders against the French, in Hungary against the
Turks, and in Tangier against the Moors, and I was
never so much in love before; and split me, madam,
in all the campaigns I ever made, I have not seen so
fine a woman as your ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> And from all the men I ever saw, I never had
so fine a compliment: but you soldiers are the best
bred men, that we must allow.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Some of us, madam; but there are brutes
among us too, very sad brutes; for my own part, I
have always had the good luck to prove agreeable. I
have had very considerable offers, madam&mdash;I might
have married a German princess, worth fifty thousand
crowns a-year, but her stove disgusted me. The
daughter of a Turkish bashaw fell in love with me,
too, when I was a prisoner among the Infidels; she
offered to rob her father of his treasure, and make
her escape with me; but I don't know how, my time
was not come: hanging and marriage, you know, go
by destiny: Fate has reserved me for a Shropshire
lady, worth twenty thousand pounds. Do you know
any such person, madam?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Extravagant coxcomb! [<i>Aside.</i>] To be sure,
a great many ladies of that fortune would be proud
of the name of Mrs. Brazen.</p>

she is called the Melinda, a first rate I can assure
you; she sheered off with him just now, on purpose
to affront me; but according to your advice I
would take no notice, because I would seem to be
above a concern for her behaviour; but have a care
of a quarrel.</p>

my cups, but an oyster-wench, or a cookmaid, and if
they ben't civil, I knock them down. But hearkye,

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Ay, ay, a sad dog.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> A very sad dog. Give me the money, noble

<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Bullock</span>, <i>meeting</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Where have you been, you great booby? you
are always out of the way in the time of preferment.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Preferment! who should prefer me?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I would prefer you! who should prefer a man,
but a woman? Come, throw away that great club,
hold up your head, cock your hat, and look big.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Ah, Rouse, Rouse! I fear somebody will look
big sooner than folk think of. Here has been Cartwheel,
your sweetheart; what will become of him?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Lookye, I'm a great woman, and will provide
for my relations: I told the captain how finely he
played upon the tabor and pipe, so he sat him down
for drum-major.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Nay, sister, why did not you keep that place
for me? you know I have always loved to be a drumming,
if it were but on a table, or on a quart pot.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sylvia</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Had I but a commission in my pocket, I fancy
my breeches would become me as well as any ranting
fellow of them all; for I take a bold step, a rakish toss,
and an impudent air, to be the principal ingredients
in the composition of a captain. What's here? Rose,
my nurse's daughter! I'll go and practise. Come,
child, kiss me at once. [<i>Kisses her.</i>] And her brother
too! Well, honest Dungfork, do you know the difference
between a horse and a cart, and a cart-horse, eh?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> I presume that your worship is a captain, by
your clothes and your courage.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Suppose I were, would you be contented to
list, friend?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> No, no; though your worship be a handsome
man, there be others as fine as you. My brother is
engaged to Captain Plume.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Plume! do you know Captain Plume?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Yes, I do, and he knows me. He took the
ribbands out of his shirt sleeves, and put them into my
shoes: see there&mdash;I can assure you that I can do any
thing with the captain.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> That is, in a modest way, sir. Have a care
what you say, Rouse; don't shame your parentage.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Nay, for that matter, I am not so simple as
to say that I can do any thing with the captain but
what I may do with any body else.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> So!<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>And pray what do you expect from
this captain, child?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I expect sir!&mdash;I expect&mdash;but he ordered me
to tell nobody&mdash;but suppose he should propose to
marry me?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You should have a care, my dear! men will
promise any thing beforehand.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I know that; but he promised to marry me
afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Wauns! Rouse, what have you said?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Afterwards! After what?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> After I had sold my chickens&mdash;I hope there's
no harm in that.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Plume</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Plume.</i> What, Mr. Wilful so close with my market
woman!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I'll try if he loves her. [<i>Aside.</i>] Close, sir, ay,
and closer yet, sir. Come, my pretty maid, you and
I will withdraw a little.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> No, no, friend, I han't done with her yet.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Nor have I begun with her; so I have as good
a right as you have.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Thou'rt a bloody impudent fellow!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sir, I would qualify myself for the service.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Hast thou really a mind to the service?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Yes, sir, so let her go.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Pray, gentlemen, don't be so violent.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Come, leave it to the girl's own choice.
Will you belong to me or to that gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Let me consider; you're both very handsome.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Now the natural inconstancy of her sex begins
to work.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Pray, sir, what will you give me?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Dunna be angry, sir, that my sister should be
mercenary, for she's but young.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Give thee, child! I'll set thee above scandal;
you shall have a coach with six before and six behind;
an equipage to make vice fashionable, and put
virtue out of countenance.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Pho! that's easily done: I'll do more for
thee, child, I'll buy you a furbelow-scarf, and give
you a ticket to see a play.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> A play! wauns! Rouse, take the ticket, and
let's see the show.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Lookye, captain, if you won't resign, I'll go list
with Captain Brazen this minute.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Will you list with me if I give up my title?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Take her; I'll change a woman for a man
at any time.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> I have heard before, indeed, that you captains
used to sell your men.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Pray, captain, do not send Rouse to the Western
Indies.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Ha! ha! ha! West Indies! No, no, my
honest lad, give me thy hand; nor you nor she shall
move a step farther than I do. This gentleman is one
of us, and will be kind to you, Mrs. Rose.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> But will you be so kind to me, sir, as the
captain would?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I can't be altogether so kind to you; my circumstances
are not so good as the captain's; but I'll
take care of you, upon my word.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Ay, ay, we'll all take care of her; she shall
live like a princess, and her brother here shall be&mdash;What
would you be?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Oh, sir, if you had not promised the place of
drum-major!</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Ay, that is promised; but what think you
of barrack-master? you are a person of understanding,
and barrack-master you shall be&mdash;But what's become
of this same Cartwheel you told me of, my dear?</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> We'll go fetch him&mdash;Come, brother barrack-master&mdash;We
shall find you at home, noble captain?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smallcaps">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Bullock</span>.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Yes, yes; and now, sir, here are your forty
shillings.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Captain Plume, I despise your listing money;
if I do serve, 'tis purely for love&mdash;of that wench, I
mean&mdash;now let me beg you to lay aside your recruiting
airs, put on the man of honour, and tell me plainly
what usage I must expect when I am under your
command?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Your usage will chiefly depend upon your
behaviour; only this you must expect, that if you
commit a small fault I will excuse it; if a great one
I'll discharge you; for something tells me I shall not
be able to punish you.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> And something tells me that if you do discharge
me 'twill be the greatest punishment you can
inflict; for were we this moment to go upon the greatest
dangers in your profession, they would be less
terrible to me than to stay behind you&mdash;And now, your
hand, this lists me&mdash;and now you are my captain.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Your friend. 'Sdeath! there's something
in this fellow that charms me.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> One favour I must beg&mdash;this affair will make
some noise, and I have some friends that would censure
my conduct, if I threw myself into the circumstance
of a private centinel of my own head&mdash;I must
therefore take care to be impressed by the act of parliament;
you shall leave that to me.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> What you please as to that&mdash;Will you lodge
at my quarters in the mean time?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> No, no, captain; you forget Rose; she's to
be my bedfellow, you know.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I had forgot: pray be kind to her.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> You are thoughtful, madam, am not I worthy
to know the cause?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Oh, Lucy! I can hold my secret no longer.
You must know, that hearing of a famous fortune-teller
in town, I went disguised to satisfy a curiosity which
has cost me dear. The fellow is certainly the devil,
or one of his bosom-favourites: he has told me the
most surprising things of my past life.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Things past, madam, can hardly be reckoned
surprising, because we know them already. Did he tell
you any thing surprising that was to come?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> One thing very surprising; he said, I should
die a maid!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Die a maid! come into the world for nothing!&mdash;Dear
madam! if you should believe him, it
might come to pass; for the bare thought on't might
kill one in four and twenty hours&mdash;And did you ask
him any questions about me?</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> You! why I passed for you.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> So 'tis I that am to die a maid&mdash;But the devil
was a liar from the beginning; he can't make me
die a maid&mdash;I've put it out of his power already.<span class="ind1">&nbsp;</span> [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I do but jest. I would have passed for you,
and called myself Lucy; but he presently told me my
name, my quality, my fortune, and gave me the whole
history of my life. He told me of a lover I had in
this country, and described Worthy exactly, but in
nothing so well as in his present indifference&mdash;I fled to
him for refuge here to-day; he never so much as encouraged
me in my fright, but coldly told me that he
was sorry for the accident, because it might give the
town cause to censure my conduct; excused his not
waiting on me home, made me a careless bow, and
walked off&mdash;'Sdeath! I could have stabbed him or myself,
'twas the same thing&mdash;Yonder he comes&mdash;I will
so use him!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Don't exasperate him; consider what the
fortune-teller told you. Men are scarce, and as times
go it is not impossible for a woman to die a maid.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> 'Tis so, madam&mdash;the word demonstration
comes from D&aelig;mon, the father of lies.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Well, doctor, I'm convinced: and now, pray,
what account can you give of my future fortune?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Before the sun has made one course round
this earthly globe, your fortune will be fixed for happiness
or misery.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What! so near the crisis of my fate?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Let me see&mdash;About the hour of ten to-morrow
morning you will be saluted by a gentleman who
will come to take his leave of you, being designed for
travel; his intention of going abroad is sudden, and
the occasion a woman. Your fortune and his are like
the bullet and the barrel, one runs plump into the
other&mdash;In short, if the gentleman travels, he will die
abroad, and if he does you will die before he comes
home.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> What sort of a man is he?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Madam, he's a fine gentleman, and a lover;
that is, a man of very good sense, and a very great
fool.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> How is that possible, doctor?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Because, madam&mdash;because it is so&mdash;A woman's
reason is the best for a man's being a fool.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Ten o'clock, you say?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Ten&mdash;about the hour of tea-drinking throughout
the kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Here, doctor. [<i>Gives Money.</i>] Lucy, have you
any questions to ask?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Oh, madam! a thousand.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I must beg your patience till another time,
for I expect more company this minute; besides, I
must discharge the gentleman under the table.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> O, pray, sir, discharge us first!</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Lookye, Mr. Scale, for my own part I shall
be very tender in what regards the officers of the

<p><i>Const.</i> May it please your worships, we took them
in the very act, <i>re infecta</i>, sir&mdash;The gentleman, indeed,
behaved himself like a gentleman, for he drew
his sword and swore, and afterwards laid it down and
said nothing.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Give the gentleman his sword again&mdash;Wait
you without. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smallcaps">Constable</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Watch</span>.] I'm
sorry, sir, [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sylvia</span>.] to know a gentleman upon
such terms, that the occasion of our meeting should
prevent the satisfaction of an acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sir, you need make no apology for your warrant,
no more than I shall do for my behaviour&mdash;my
innocence is upon an equal foot with your authority.</p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> Innocence! have you not seduced that young
maid?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> No, Mr. Goosecap, she seduced me.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> So she did, I'll swear&mdash;for she proposed marriage
first.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> What, then you are married, child? [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Rose</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i> Yes, sir, to my sorrow.</p>

spoke jokes by their bedside, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Who was the minister?</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Minister! we are soldiers, and want no minister&mdash;they
were married by the articles of war.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Hold thy prating, fool<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Your appearance,
sir, promises some understanding; pray, what does
this fellow mean?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> He means marriage, I think&mdash;but that, you
know, is so odd a thing, that hardly any two people
under the sun agree in the ceremony; but among soldiers
'tis most sacred&mdash;our sword, you know, is our
honour, that we lay down&mdash;the Hero jumps over it
first, and the Amazon after&mdash;Leap, rogue; follow,
whore&mdash;the drum beats a ruff, and so to bed: that's
all: the ceremony is concise.</p>

take snuff with a pinch, pay my whores with a pinch;
in short, I can do any thing at a pinch but fight.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> And pray, sir, what brought you into Shropshire?</p>

want wit, and you know that we town gentlemen want
money, and so<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

nobody else will speak; we won't come here for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> This man is but one man, the country may
spare him, and the army wants him; besides, he's
cut out by nature for a grenadier; he's five feet ten
inches high; he shall box, wrestle, or dance the
Cheshire round with any man in the country; he
gets drunk every Sabbath-day, and he beats his
wife.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> You lie, sirrah, you lie; an please your
worship, he's the best natured pains-taking'st man in
the parish, witness my five poor children.</p>

you rogue, how durst you impress a man that has a
wife and five children?</p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> Discharge him, discharge him.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Hold, gentlemen. Harkye, friend, how do
you maintain your wife and five children?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> They live upon wild-fowl and venison, sir;
the husband keeps a gun, and kills all the hares and
partridges within five miles round.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> A gun! nay if he be so good at gunning, he
shall have enough on't. He may be of use against
the French, for he shoots flying to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Scrup.</i> But his wife and children, Mr. Balance?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Ay, ay, that's the reason you would send him
away; you know I have a child every year, and
you are afraid that they should come upon the parish
at last.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Lookye there, gentlemen; the honest woman
has spoke it at once; the parish had better maintain
five children this year, than six or seven the next.
That fellow, upon this high feeding, may get you two
or three beggars at a birth.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Lookye, Mr. Captain, the parish shall get
nothing by sending him away, for I won't lose
my teeming-time, if there be a man left in the
parish.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Send that woman to the house of correction,<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>and
the man<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> I'll take care of him, if you please.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Takes him down.</i></p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> Here, you constable, the next. Set up
that black-faced fellow, he has a gunpowder look;
what can you say against this man, constable?</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Nothing, but that he's a very honest man.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Pray, gentlemen, let me have one honest
man in my company, for the novelty's sake.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> What are you, friend?</p>

<p><i>Mob.</i> A collier; I work in the coal-pits.</p>

<p><i>Scrup.</i> Lookye, gentlemen, this fellow has a trade,
and the act of parliament here expresses, that we are
to impress no man that has any visible means of a
livelihood.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> May it please your worship, this man has no
visible means of a livelihood, for he works underground.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Well said, Kite; besides, the army wants
miners.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Right, and had we an order of government
for't, we could raise you in this and the neighbouring
county of Stafford, five hundred colliers, that
would run you under ground like moles, and do
more service in a siege, than all the miners in the
army.</p>

<p><i>Scrup.</i> Well, friend, what have you to say for yourself?</p>

<p><i>Mob.</i> I'm married.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Lack-a-day! so am I.</p>

<p><i>Mob.</i> Here's my wife, poor woman.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Are you married, good woman?</p>

<p><i>Woman.</i> I'm married in conscience.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> May it please your worship, she's with child
in conscience.</p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> Who married you, mistress?</p>

<p><i>Woman.</i> My husband: we agreed that I should
call him husband, to avoid passing for a whore, and
that he should call me wife, to shun going for a
soldier.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> A very pretty couple! What say you, Mr.
Kite? will you take care of the woman?</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Yes, sir, she shall go with us to the sea-side,
and there, if she has a mind to drown herself, we'll
take care nobody shall hinder her.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Here, constable, bring in my man.[<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Constable</span>.] Now, captain, I'll fit you with a man
such as you never listed in your life.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Constable</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sylvia</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Oh, my friend Pinch! I'm very glad to see you.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Well, sir, and what then?</p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> What then! is that your respect to the
bench?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sir, I don't care a farthing for you, nor your
bench neither.</p>

<p><i>Scrup.</i> Lookye, gentlemen, that's enough; he's a
very impudent fellow, and fit for a soldier.</p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> A notorious rogue, I say, and very fit for a
soldier.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> A whoremaster, I say, and therefore fit to
go.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> What think you, captain?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I think he's a very pretty fellow, and therefore
fit to serve.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Me for a soldier! send your own lazy lubberly
sons at home; fellows that hazard their necks every
day, in the pursuit of a fox, yet dare not peep abroad
to look an enemy in the face.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> May it please your worships, I have a woman
at the door to swear a rape against this rogue.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Is it your wife, or daughter, booby?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Pray, captain, read the articles of war; we'll
see him listed immediately.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> [Reads. <i>Articles of war, against mutiny and
desertion, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Hold, sir<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Once more, gentlemen, have a
care what you do; for you shall severely smart for
any violence you offer to me; and you, Mr. Balance,
I speak to you particularly, you shall heartily repent
it.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Lookye, young spark, say but one word
more, and I'll build a horse for you as high as the
cieling, and make you ride the most tiresome journey
that ever you made in your life.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You have made a fine speech, good Captain
Huff-cap! but you had better be quiet; I shall find
a way to cool your courage.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Pray, gentlemen, don't mind him, he's distracted.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> 'Tis false! I am descended of as good a family
as any in your county; my father is as good a man
as any upon your bench, and I am heir to twelve hundred
pounds a-year.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> He's certainly mad. Pray, captain, read the
articles of war.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Hold, once more. Pray, Mr. Balance, to you
I speak; suppose I were your child, would you use
me at this rate?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> No, 'faith: were you mine, I would send you
to Bedlam first, and into the army afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> But consider my father, sir; he's as good, as
generous, as brave, as just a man as ever served his
country; I'm his only child; perhaps the loss of me
may break his heart.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> He's a very great fool if it does. Captain, if
you don't list him this minute, I'll leave the court.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Kite, do you distribute the levy money to
the men, while I read.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Ay, sir. Silence, gentlemen!</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smallcaps">Plume</span> <i>reads the Articles of War</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Very well; now, captain, let me beg the favour
of you not to discharge this fellow, upon any
account whatsoever. Bring in the rest.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> There are no more, an't please your worship.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> No more! There were five, two hours ago.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> 'Tis true, sir; but this rogue of a constable let
the rest escape, for a bribe of eleven shillings a man,
because he said the act allowed him but ten, so the
odd shilling was clear gains.</p>

<p><i>All Just.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Gentlemen, he offered to let me go away for
two guineas, but I had not so much about me: this
is truth, and I am ready to swear it.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> And I'll swear it: give me the book&mdash;'tis for
the good of the service.</p>

<p><i>Mob.</i> May it please your worship, I gave him half
a crown, to say that I was an honest man; but now,
since that your worships have made me a rogue, I
hope I shall have my money again.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> 'Tis my opinion, that this constable be put
into the captain's hands, and if his friends don't bring
four good men for his ransom by to-morrow night,
captain, you shall carry him to Flanders.</p>

<p><i>Scale.</i> <i>Scrup.</i> Agreed, agreed.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Mr. Kite, take the constable into custody.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Ay, ay, sir. [<i>To the</i> <span class="smallcaps">Constable</span>.] Will
you please to have your office taken from you? or
will you handsomely lay down your staff, as your
betters have done before you?</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smallcaps">Constable</span> <i>drops his Staff</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Come, gentlemen, there needs no great ceremony
in adjourning this court. Captain, you shall
dine with me.</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i> Come, Mr. Militia Serjeant, I shall silence
you now, I believe, without your taking the law of
me.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Balance</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Steward</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Stew.</i> We did not miss her till the evening, sir;
and then, searching for her in the chamber that was
my young master's, we found her clothes there; but
the suit that your son left in the press, when he went
to London, was gone.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> The white, trimm'd with silver?</p>

<p><i>Stew.</i> The same.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> You ha'n't told that circumstance to any
body?</p>

<p><i>Stew.</i> To none but your worship.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> And be sure you don't. Go into the dining-room,
and tell Captain Plume that I beg to speak
with him.</p>

<p><i>Stew.</i> I shall.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Was ever man so imposed upon! I had her
promise, indeed, that she would never dispose of herself
without my consent&mdash;I have consented with a
witness, given her away as my act and my deed&mdash;and
this, I warrant, the captain thinks will pass. No, I
shall never pardon him the villany, first, of robbing
me of my daughter, and then the mean opinion he
must have of me, to think that I could be so wretchedly
imposed upon: her extravagant passion might
encourage her in the attempt, but the contrivance
must be his. I'll know the truth presently.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Plume</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pray, captain, what have you done with our young
gentleman soldier?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> He's at my quarters, I suppose, with the
rest of my men.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Does he keep company with the common soldiers?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> No, he's generally with me.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> He lies with you, I presume?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> No, 'faith; the young rogue fell in love
with Rose, and has lain with her, I think, since she
came to town.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> So that between you both, Rose has been
finely managed.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Upon my honour, sir, she had no harm
from me.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> All's safe, I find&mdash;Now, captain, you must
know, that the young fellow's impudence in court
was well grounded; he said I should heartily repent
his being listed, and so I do, from my soul.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Ay! for what reason?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Because he is no less than what he said he
was&mdash;born of as good a family as any in this county,
and he is heir to twelve hundred pounds a-year.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> I'm very glad to hear it&mdash;for I wanted but
a man of that quality to make my company a perfect
representative of the whole commons of England.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Won't you discharge him?</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Not under a hundred pounds sterling.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> You shall have it, for his father is my intimate
friend.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Then you shall have him for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Nay, sir, you shall have your price.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Not a penny, sir; I value an obligation to
you much above an hundred pounds.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Perhaps, sir, you shan't repent your
generosity<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Will you please to write his discharge in my
pocket-book? [<i>Gives his Book.</i>] In the mean time,
we'll send for the gentleman. Who waits there?</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Steward</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Go to the captain's lodging, and inquire for Mr.
Wilful; tell him his captain wants him here immediately.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Sir, the gentleman's below at the door, inquiring
for the captain.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Bid him come up. Here's the discharge,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Sir, I thank you&mdash;'Tis plain he had no hand
in't.<span class="ind1">&nbsp;</span>[<i>Aside.</i></p>

 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sylvia</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I think, captain, you might have used me
better, than to leave me yonder among your swearing
drunken crew; and you, Mr. Justice, might have
been so civil as to have invited me to dinner, for I
have eaten with as good a man as your worship.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Sir, you must charge our want of respect
upon our ignorance of your quality&mdash;but now you
are at liberty, I have discharged you.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Discharged me!</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Yes, sir, and you must once more go home to
your father.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> My father! then I am discovered<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Oh,
sir! [<i>Kneeling.</i>] I expect no pardon.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Pardon! no, no, child; your crime shall be
your punishment: here, captain, I deliver her over
to the conjugal power, for her chastisement. Since
she will be a wife, be you a husband, a very husband&mdash;When
she tells you of her love, upbraid her with
her folly; be modishly ungrateful, because she has
been unfashionably kind; and use her worse than you
would any body else, because you can't use her so
well as she deserves.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> And are you, Sylvia, in good earnest?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Earnest! I have gone too far to make it jest,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> And do you give her to me in good earnest?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> If you please to take her, sir.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Why then I have saved my legs and arms,
and lost my liberty; secure from wounds, I am prepared
for the gout; farewell subsistence, and welcome
taxes&mdash;Sir, my liberty and the hope of being a
general, are much dearer to me than your twelve
hundred pounds a-year&mdash;but to your love, madam, I
resign my freedom, and, to your beauty, my ambition&mdash;greater
in obeying at your feet, than commanding
at the head of an army.</p>

<p><i>Wor.</i> I am sorry to hear, Mr. Balance, that your

<p><i>Mel.</i> Pray, Mr. Balance, what's become of my
cousin Sylvia?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Your cousin Sylvia is talking yonder with
your cousin Plume.</p>

<p><i>Mel. and Wor.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Do you think it strange, cousin, that a woman
should change; but I hope you'll excuse a change
that has proceeded from constancy: I altered my
outside, because I was the same within, and only
laid by the woman, to make sure of my man: that's
my history.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> Your history is a little romantic, cousin; but
since success has crowned your adventures, you will
have the world on your side, and I shall be willing to
go with the tide, provided you'll pardon an injury I
offered you in the letter to your father.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> That injury, madam, was done to me, and
the reparation I expect, shall be made to my friend:
make Mr. Worthy happy, and I shall be satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> A good example, sir, will go a great way&mdash;When
my cousin is pleased to surrender, 'tis probable
I shan't hold out much longer.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Gentlemen, I am yours&mdash;Madam, I am
not yours.</p>

<p><i>Mel.</i> I'm glad on't, sir.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> So am I&mdash;You have got a pretty house
here, Mr. Laconic.</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> 'Tis time to right all mistakes&mdash;My name, sir,
is Balance.</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Balance! Sir, I am your most obedient&mdash;I
know your whole generation&mdash;had not you an uncle
that was governor of the Leeward Islands, some years
ago?</p>

<p><i>Bal.</i> Did you know him?</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Intimately, sir, he played at billiards to a
miracle&mdash;You had a brother too, that was a captain
of a fire-ship&mdash;poor Dick&mdash;he had the most engaging
way with him of making punch&mdash;and then his cabin
was so neat&mdash;but his poor boy Jack was the most comical
bastard&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! a pickled
dog, I shall never forget him.</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Have you got your recruits, my dear?</p>

<p><i>Brazen.</i> Not a stick, my dear!</p>

<p><i>Plume.</i> Probably I shall furnish you, my dear!
instead of the twenty thousand pounds you talked of,
you shall have the twenty brave recruits that I have
raised, at the rate they cost me<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>My commission I
lay down, to be taken up by some braver fellow, that
has more merit, and less good fortune&mdash;whilst I endeavour,
by the example of this worthy gentleman,
to serve my king and country at home.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
